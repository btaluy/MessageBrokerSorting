# parallel computing project (Message broker) created by Berfu and Janine.

This small program was created for a school project (parallel computing) and its used to show how we can use activeMQ to send and receive messages which we can parallel sort.

## Requirements
The very first requirement is to have apache activeMQ installed and should be started up.
STEPS to follow:
```javascript
 1. Download the ActiveMQ zip/tar.gz from http://activemq.apache.org/download.html
 2. Unzip the file to your preferred location The steps here follow the location of ~/Downloads (in this example for Mac
    OS, similarly for unix/linux variants).
 3. Change the mode of activemq directory (chmod 755, should be sufficient)
 4. Navigate to the start file location.
 5. Start the ActiveMQ message broker. (~/apache-activemq-5.9.0/bin and then type in terminal "sudo sh activemq start" without the quotes)
 6. Once its started go to: localhost:8161 and login in (default account: admin admin)
```

## installation
#### It's mandatory that you follow the installation proccess.
```javascript
 1. Download the messageBrokerSorting project from github.
 2. Run with intelliJ (or a IDE by choice, I've made this project with InteliJ and should best work with it) After you have started up the message broker.
```
